I am a second-year PhD student supervised by 
[Bertrand Thirion](https://pages.saclay.inria.fr/bertrand.thirion/) 
at [Inria MIND](https://team.inria.fr/mind/) and 
[Denis Engemann](https://denis-engemann.de/) at Roche.
My research focuses on statistical machine learning methods for measuring 
and explaining the importance of variables in complex prediction problems. 
My research is motivated by applications in clinical neuroscience, 
and in particular Alzheimer's disease. 


### PhD project 🧠
Machine learning (AI) models are increasingly powerful at predicting 
outcomes from complex biomedical data, such as neuroimaging, proteomics, and 
genomics. In Alzheimer's disease research, this translates to better diagnosis 
and tracking of disease progression. However, in critical healthcare 
applications, accurate prediction is not enough. It is necessary to understand 
what the model bases its prediction on and to uncover the underlying biology.

This is the problem my PhD focuses on: developing methods to explain what ML 
models are learning from complex neuroscience data. A central goal is to 
provide these explanations with rigorous statistical guarantees, a crucial 
requirement to control the risk of making false discoveries in clinical 
applications.

### Open-source 🧑‍💻
Open-source software is essential for reproducible research and scientific 
collaboration. To support this effort, I contribute to developing and 
maintaining [hidimstat](https://hidimstat.github.io/dev), a library providing statistical methods to measure 
variable importance in prediction problems. It aims to provide a wide range of 
methods, covering classic baselines and recent advances, with examples 
illustrating how to apply them in different contexts.
